This project solves some usual API Gateway drawbacks. There are many ways to implement an *API Gateway* at server-side... Imagining it as a simple *router*, there are two ways: as a independent software package (like [npmjs.com/http-proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-proxy)), and  as an application of the  [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) (eg. Nginx or Apache), by its rewrite module for [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy).

This project is an specialilized solution for [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) &mdash; that use a script language to express reverse-proxy and implement it. The main software piece here is a **[code generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_generation_(compiler)) for [Nginx rewrite module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html)**.  This project also uses  [_convention over configuration_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) principle to merge some conventions to the code generation, reducing scope without lost of usability. The main convention is that **all APIs**, to be grouped by the gateway, **are specified in [OpenAPI JSON files](https://www.openapis.org/specification/repo)**.

## Motivations

The agregation of microservices in the server must be easy, and, when microservices are OpenAPI specifications, must be plug-and-play... And not something vendor-dependent (as Amazon, APIumbrella, TYK, etc. solutions).  The most "independent and popular" way is by Nginx (or Apache) rewrite script. It is perfect, but have some drawbacks:<sup>[1]</sup>

* the API Gateway itself (as another highly available component) must be developed, deployed, and managed. 
* a risk that the API Gateway becomes a development bottleneck &mdash; developers must update the API Gateway in order to expose each microserviceâ€™s endpoints... and developers will be forced to wait in line in order to update the gateway.

Other important motivation was the need (in [agile developing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) and [prototyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping)) for tests and generalized *endpoints*, as offered by [PostREST](https://postgrest.com) and similar back-end solutions.<sup>[2]</sup> 

## Approach and implementation

The [swagger.io/tools](http://swagger.io/tools/) implements  its code generation with [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/),  and developing templates with sucess by [collaborative development model](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). So, the purpose here is to use Mustache and gradual-collaborative growing.

## Summarizing

The API Gateway acts as a dedicated orchestration layer for all your backend APIs, to separate orchestration from implementation concerns. The gateway is a Nginx script generated from the OpenAPI specifications of each microservice (adding some `x-` properties when need), and the `openapi-gateway.json` file.

Leverages the governance capabilities of the API Manager, so that you can apply throttling, security, and other policies to your APIs.
