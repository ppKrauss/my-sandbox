FIRST DRAFT.

Generates data for PostgreSQL database and use it as "online lab" with PostgREST.

See [experiment01.csv](experiment01.csv) for results and *.php for algorithms. Header description at [metadata.json](metadata.json).

To compare results (in SQL or spreadsheets) use `samples/spN` percentual as "sampling reliability",  and `keys/samples`, `collisions/keys` and `collisions/samples`  for group comparisions.
